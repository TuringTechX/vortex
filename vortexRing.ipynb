    "The given code generates a 3D visualization of a vortex ring. The vortex ring is modeled as a series of small vortex filaments that are generated by discretizing the ring into many small segments. The velocity at each point in a 3D grid is calculated due to the vortex ring using the Biot-Savart law. Finally, the streamlines of the velocity field are plotted in the z=0 plane using matplotlib's streamplot function, resulting in a 3D visualization of the vortex ring."
