[Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of the alternating current ([AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current)) electrical system. He is also known for his pioneering work in the fields of wireless communication, radio, and X-rays.

## 369 obsession

Regarding the number [369](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369_(number)) in mathematics, Tesla believed it had great significance and even referred to it as "the key to the universe." He believed that these numbers had a fundamental role in the structure of the universe and were related to the generation and transmission of energy.

Tesla's interest in 369 may have stemmed from his fascination with the patterns and symmetry of numbers. He was known to be a deeply spiritual person who saw numbers as being imbued with mystical properties.

He was rumored to have a peculiar routine of circling the block thrice before entering any building. Furthermore, he insisted on booking hotel rooms with numbers divisible by three. Additionally, he frequently computed the volumes and weights of ordinary items and based his judgments on whether they aligned with the number 369.

### What makes 369 unique?

[Vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) mathematics is frequently used to elucidate the [importance of 369](https://www.academia.edu/44905399/Tesla_369_The_Key_to_Warp_Drive "369 Tesla Warp Drive") ("The Key to Warp Drive"), as explained in this article on Tesla's 369 and its role in warp drive.

The concept of Vortex mathematics pertains to the observed pattern that arises from the natural and divine occurrences within our universe. One example is the process of life, which commences with a single cell that divides into two, then four, eight, and so forth, leading to the creation of an entire organism.

By continuously computing the [digital root](https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1271&context=acadfest) of these doubling numbers, all single-digit numbers are obtained except for three, six, and nine. This raises questions about the significance of the number 369 and whether it holds any spiritual connotations. Is there a deeper meaning behind this pattern?

Nikola Tesla viewed 369 as significant focal points symbolizing elevated dimensions, while the remaining single-digit numbers pertain to our fundamental three-dimensional existence.

### What was the reason behind Tesla's preference for doing things in threes?

Due to his fascination with the vortex patterns of 369, Tesla adhered to a practice of conducting everything in sets of three. His reverence for the sanctity of the number three compelled him to perform most actions in triplicate.

Nikola Tesla had [unconventional habits](https://web.mit.edu/most/Public/Tesla1/etradict2.htm "Nikola Tesla 3 6 9 Biography")), such as sleeping for just three hours at a time and working from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., before returning to work for an additional three, six, or nine hours after dinner. Despite this rigorous routine, he lived to the impressive age of 87, with a digital root of six. Tesla attributed his remarkable success to the power of the 369 code and its ability to enhance consciousness, which he believed granted him inexplicable benefits.

As a result of his unwavering commitment to the 369, Tesla created a [multitude of inventions](https://www.fi.edu/case-files/nikola-tesla) and spearheaded numerous innovations that continue to influence our world today. Among his most notable contributions are the [tesla coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil), alternating current, a plethora of other gadgets, and even the groundwork for mathematical concepts that would not be validated until many years later, such as [String Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory).

### Can you explain the 369 theory developed by Nikola Tesla?

According to Nikola Tesla's 369 theory, the figures three, six, and nine symbolize dimensions beyond our three-dimensional world. Additionally, the hypothesis suggests that each of these numbers, **particularly nine, governs the principles of our cosmos**. These revered digits serve as the basis for achieving enlightenment and act as "a key to the universe," in Tesla's own words.

## The significance of 3, 6, and 9 in unlocking the secrets of the universe

Picture a clock that begins with nine at the top instead of 12. The principles governing existence mandate a predetermined, celestial course of action that adheres to a universal design. When computing the digital root of any doubled figure from one to infinity, the resulting digital root will be either one, two, four, five, seven or eight. Never will three, six or nine emerge.

**The trinities explained**

| Trinities | &nbsp; | Sum | Differences | Digital Root |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 + 2 + 3 | equals | 6 | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| 4 + 5 + 6 | equals | 15 | 9 | 1 + 5 = 6 |
| 7 + 8 + 9 | equals | 24 | 9 | 2 + 4 = 6 |
| 10 + 11 + 12 | equals | 33 | 9 | 3 + 3 = 6 |
| 13 + 14 + 15 | equals | 42 | 9 | 4 + 2 = 6 |
| 16 + 17 + 18 | equals | 51 | 9 | 5 + 1 = 6 |

Now on this clock of nine, you can trace the doubling of one, two, four, and eight. However, eight doubled is 16, the sum of which is seven. Seven doubled is 14, the sum of which is five. Five doubled is 10, the sum of which is one, and the cycle then repeats itself forever. The design traced out by doubling and calculating digital roots produces an infinity-like symbol. The 369 triangle meaning is a higher plane of existence than the one we currently occupy.
